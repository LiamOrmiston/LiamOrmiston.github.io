    <h3>Iris by Lowe's - Part time Platform Intern</h3>
    <p>
      I work part-time with a company I interned for over the Summer of 2017, Iris by Lowe's Smart Home Technology. In this position I work with 2
      other interns on a Scrum Team using Agile software development techniques. This position I have learned how to balance academics, work, and 
      personal life. In this position I will use Java in order to work on backend services for the platform. I will get more familiar with Docker,
      Bamboo, and making changes that affect many users on a massive scale. I'm looking forward to see how this will differ from my Summer internship.
      Be sure to checkout my internship post to learn more about what I did over the summer.</p>

    <h3>Student Housing - Resident Assistant</h3>
    <p>
      I am also currently a Resident Assistant in Hashinger, the Arts Community Residence Hall, where I oversee and mentor 60 students of all grades.
      Through this position I have sharpened my communication skills and enhanced my emotional intelligence. This job requires me to
      respond quickly in crisis situations as well as establish an inclusive and supportive community within the floor. The reason why
      I love my job is because I get to help students feel at home and provide a support system that will launch them towards success.

    <h2>Summer Internship</h2>
    <p>
      Over the summer I worked for Iris by Lowe's as a WebUI Intern. Iris by Lowe's is an IoT company that allows users to have a DIY approach at a 
      Smart Home. Since I was the only intern on the Scrum Team, I got to work and learn very closely with Senior developers. I often worked with remote 
      developers which was something that I had never experienced before. Working with remote developers taught me how to communicate effectively and to 
      ask for help when I needed it. From the very beginning, I was thrown into the deep end and treated as an equal developer. I filed tickets, squashed bugs, 
      submitted pull requests, pair programmed, reviewed other developers code, and merged my own code to production. I have become familiar using different 
      frameworks such as DoneJS, CanJS, MustacheJS, as well as using Agile development techniques. I used Atlassian's development software such as Bitbucket, 
      SourceTree, Confluence, and Jira.
