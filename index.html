              <p>A project that I took on as a software developer was for One Thousand Bison. The client had a 3D logo that they wanted to be interactive on their website to increase user retention and provide a custom experience you can't get anywhere else. I crafted a custom software solution utilizing 3D web technologies to enable the logo's rendering, shading, and rotation. I created custom JavaScript code to control bison rotation based on the user's mouse position. To facilitate rapid feedback with the client, I made a custom website so they could fine-tune the exact user experience they wanted. Once completed, I helped manage the code integration into their existing WebFlow site.</p>

              <p>My primary role involved managing our internal research pipelines, which are critical for handling an extensive amount of data, over five petabytes. I played a key part in updating our systems by co-leading the shift from using Luigi to Airflow, which significantly modernized our research workflow. To assist our Research analysts in adapting to Airflow, I developed custom wrappers that facilitated a smooth transition.</p>
              <p>My involvement with Airflow extended beyond our company as I actively engaged with the wider community through contributing to the Airflow GitHub repository. This included making pull requests and reporting bugs to help improve the tool for all users.</p>
              <p>I also took the initiative to enhance our data processing by converting MapReduce overnight jobs into PySpark, which resulted in gains in both efficiency and code readability. Additionally, I shared my knowledge across the company by delivering presentations on Git best practices, with a focus on maintaining code integrity and fostering better collaboration among our teams.</p>

I also worked closely with the User Experience (UX) and Audio teams to design and incorporate unique sounds into the product, enhancing its features.
              <p>To improve our work processes, I established a new standard for debug logging within our department, aiming to benefit future projects with more streamlined troubleshooting. When faced with tight schedules, I efficiently overhauled the process for incorporating CarPlay and Android Auto into our system, ensuring we met our deadlines.</p>
              <p>Outside of engineering tasks, I took the initiative to promote STEM careers by speaking at high school events and helping with college recruitment, encouraging students to consider futures in technology.</p>
