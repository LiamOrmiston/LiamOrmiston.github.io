          <p>I am currently a student at the University of Kansas studying
            Computer Science minoring in Communication Studies. I am currently
            looking for an internship for the summer of 2018. I have a passion
            for nature and sustainability. Some of my current obsessions
            include: being vegan, reusable straws and ice cubes, yoga, bicycle
            messengers, fixed gear racing, long distance thru hikes, Rick and
            Morty, and making people feel welcomed.</p>

          <h3 class="heading-2">Summer 2017</h3>
          <p>Last summer I interned with a IoT company based in Lawrence, KS
            that specializes in smart home devices called Iris by Lowe's. I
            was integrated as a WebUI Developer and worked on the scrum team
            that included remote developers in order to improve the Iris Web
            App. Over the course of the summer, I successfully submitted over
            20 pull requests that were approved and implemented into production.
            The most important thing that I learned from the summer was the
            professional development process and workflow. It was very new to
            me to be working on such a large scale project that effected
            thousands of people who use the product every single day. One of
            the best things that I did over the summer was visit a Lowe's store
            and put together a tiny house equipped with Iris smart home products.
            I got to educate the store manager on how to use the app and how to
            personalize the devices to interact with the environment. It was
            rewarding to be able to actually see how my work effects people's
            lives and made me understand the importance of my code.</p>
          <h3 class="heading-2">Fall 2017</h3>
          <p>For the fall, I was asked to return as a part time intern from
            the company I worked at over the summer, Iris by Lowe's. I am now
            on a scrum team with two other interns on the platform side. The
            major difference from the work I did over the summer is that I am
            now away from WebUI and into working with the large user databases
            doing research in optimization and practicality. We are currently
            doing proof of concepts for many different projects the company
            wants to pursue but doesn't know how much work it might take or
            how they want to implement it to the work they already do. I find
            it very exciting to be working in the experimental stage of a company
            and able to help figure out what direction the company wants to
            move in. I feel like with this experience, I am a more well rounded
            programmer to be able learn and apply WebUI and now the same for
            Platform development.</p>

              most beautiful rock faces. Along the way I met some really
              amazing people from all disciplines and got a chance to explore
